Quite simple bunnyhop + wallhack cheat for CS:GO

Optionally, it should be updated every 1-3 days due to changing game's offsets.

Memory.h has been rewritten by me for more convenient using.

Before using this cheat, you should replace all offsets in Offsets.h. Just open CheatEngine v.3.x(does not matter), find 'csgo.exe' proccess, and then open bitmap and catch needed offsets, finally put them all in the file.

So, in order to start the cheat, just launch CS:GO and after that, run the cheat from Visual Studio. Bunnyhop works automatically, but if you want to switch on wallhack, just press on F5 :)

P.S. Also you can compile and convert it in .exe format, but I recommend to launch it from Visual Studio, because this cheat is not as optimized as I would had to.
